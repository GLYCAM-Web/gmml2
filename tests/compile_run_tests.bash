===== GMML TEST RUNNING SCRIPT =====
$0 is used to allow us to run multiple of our
test scripts at once. This is not to be confused with compiling
the test code, we will be running multiple of our scripts at once.
There exists some GNU utils that could be used to accomplish this
but we want to keep these bash scripts as bare bones as possible.

We find tests to run by globbing \"*.test.*.sh\", to disable a
test just change the file name of test you would like to disable
so it does not match that glob.
*************************************************************
Options are as follows:
\t-j <NUM_JOBS>\t\tRun <NUM_JOBS> scripts at once
\t-d bare_metal\t\tSkip tests that dont work on bare metal and need
\t\t\t\tbe run in the docker container
\t-h \t\t\tPrint this msg
