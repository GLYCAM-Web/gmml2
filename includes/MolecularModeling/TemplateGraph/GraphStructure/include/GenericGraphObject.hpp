        //	Quick tl;dr about each type & why we care.
        // 		- LEAF: Only a node can be a <leaf>, a <leaf> is a node with a SINGLE edge. In
        // 			multigraph we can consider a <leaf> as a node with a single neighbor.
        // 		- BRIDGE: A <bridge> is an edge (or node) that when deleted results in an increase
        // 			of the graphs connected-components. Think of 2 cycles (cycle1, cycle2)
        // 			connected by a single node (let us call it nodeA) where said node has 2 edges
        // 			(edgeA1, edgeA2) where edgeA1 connects nodeA to cycle1 and edgeA2 connects
        // 			nodeA to cycle2. Thus, if we delete edgeA1, edgeA2, or nodeA we will now
        // 			have two seperate connected components being cycle1 and cycle2. Thus we know
        // 			that nodeA, edgeA1, and edgeA2 are all bridges. We know a node is considered
        // 			a bridge node if all connecting edges are bridge-edges. Please note that an
        // 			edge that connects to a leaf node is also considered a bridge edge.
        // 		- INCYCLE: Due to some fun properties of graphs, we know that if an edge or
        // 			node is neither a <bridge> or leaf> we know that said element must be a
        // 			part of a cycle. In the future, this can allow for some fun optimizations
        // 			where we only run our total cycle detection on elements that we know are in
        // 			a cycle. This will help down on computational time (not always, but depending on
        // 			input it will help) by reducing the amount of elements we must run our cycle
        // 			detection algorithms on.
        //
        // //TODO: ENSURE MY REASONING IS CORRECT, FIGURE OUT BETTER NAMING TOO MUCH TYPING
        //
        // 	Why care?
        // 		- This makes oligosaccharide detection much easier due to the ability to break our
        // 			detection down into "parts". So at first we check if we are dealing with
        // 			monosaccharides, then we check the connectivity of our monosaccharides. We can
        // 			"walk" our connection between the two sugars and we need 2 conditions being that
        // 			the atoms we observe are the correct atoms and that the edges and atom that
        // 			create our connection between the two monosaccharides are considered "bridges".
        // 			If we encounter an incorrect atom, or something that is not considered a bridge
        // 			during our walk through the connection we know that the observed molecule cannot
        // 			be a oligosaccharide.
        //
        //	Quick blurb about enums: If we dont set a variable that uses our enum to a specific value
        //								the variable will be equal to our first element
        //(in our
        // case 								<UNKNOWN>). The only reason why I
        // included a specific value in our variable decleration is to just drive the point home that we are going to be
        // defaulting to UNKNOWN. It is not 								needed but does
        // help ensure there is clarity.
